# CS1300 Capstone

My capstone project extended the iterative design project, where I designed the interface for a medical blog website for a medical marketplace startup, Sesame. I chose this project because I learned a great deal about working with stakeholders and enjoyed having a real-world impact through my work. In the capstone, I refined our final design based on feedback from the founders and developed it into a fully functional website, with features that balance usability and conversion-focused interactions.
The website consists of four parts: the home page, blog page, and provider dashboard. 

### Homepage
Users can easily search for symptoms or care-related questions and browse content by featured articles, recent posts, or topic categories. I improved the previous design by creating a dedicated search results page and adding functionality to sort results by relevance, popularity, or publication date. 

### Blog page
When users click on any blog, they are taken to the blog page, which has a clean, intuitive content hierarchy, from the title to the provider video and then to the key insights. The video features the provider speaking and the key insights section uses registered users’ information to AI-generate personalized takeaways. This layout caters to both visual and text-based learners, while increasing trust and engagement.  The right-hand sidebar features two call-to-action buttons, allowing users to book an appointment or consult the provider directly while reading the blog. Clicking “Book an Appointment” opens a floating window to streamline the booking process, while clicking “Ask Doctor” opens a chat box. The blog content itself includes highlighted quotes to improve readability and call-to-action prompts to encourage subscriptions. 

### Provider Dashboard
When users click on “My Profile” in the top-right navigation bar, they are directed to the provider dashboard page. There, providers access a centralized hub where they can track blog performance through analytics, view a leaderboard to gamify participation, and draft new content using a built-in AI assistant, “Drafty AI.” These tools were intentionally designed to incentivize content creation.
